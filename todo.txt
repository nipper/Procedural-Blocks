when a tile is drawn check:

tile below
	-> redraw without grass
tile above
	-> don't draw grass

any adjacent tile:
	-> draw speckle
		- offset by 1/2 tile size in direction of tile

todo:
	1: sometimes getting 1-2 pixel 'grasses' at edge make these go away
	2: do offset described above
		- will need to create 2d grid to store tile locations
	3: edging tiles
		- by this i mean adding grass on top
		- roughening the sides
		- etc
